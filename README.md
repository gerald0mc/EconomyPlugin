# Just Another Economy Plugin

This is a plugin I started just as a little thing to keep me from being bored. It has two seperate configs one for player balances as well as the config.yml which has the values for the mob money drops as well as a toggl for it.

## Commands:

- [help] : Shows the plugins help menu.
- [balance] : Sends the players balance in chat.
- [send] [target] [amount] : Sends another player money.
- [gui] : Shows the plugin GUI.
- ====Secret OP Powers====
- [balance] [player] : Sends another players balance in chat.
- [setbal] [player] [value] : Sets a players balance to the value.
- [set] [entity] [value] : Sets a settings value to value.
- [l ist] : Shows all the settings and their values.
- [reload] : Reloads the config.

## GUI'S:

Base GUI that has a few op thing and non op things (Player Info, Balance, Reload, and View Settings).

After clicking View Settings you will be brought into another GUI which shows items related to the mob and then when you hover on it you will see the values.
